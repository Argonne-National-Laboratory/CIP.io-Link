# This is a CIPio Link install test

Nothing to see here. I will be removed in the next 48hrs anyway.

Copy and paste the following command to install this package using CIPio:

```bash

wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnystrom/cipiotest/main/scripts/install.sh -O /tmp/install.sh && chmod +x /tmp/install.sh && /tmp/install.sh

```
