# This is a CIPio Link install test

Nothing to see here. I will be removed in the next 48hrs anyway.

Copy and paste the following command to install this package using CIPio:

```bash

wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/CIP.io-Link/main/scripts/install.sh -O /tmp/install.sh && \
    chmod +x /tmp/install.sh && \
    /tmp/install.sh

```
